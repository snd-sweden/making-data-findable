# Making data findable

This site provides recommendations for making research data publications *findable* in common metadata flows so they can be discovered, linked, cited, and followed up over time.

### What do we mean by “findable”?

In this context, findability means: that a data publication can be uniquely identified and reliably connected to:

* the people involved (e.g. ORCID)  
* the organisations involved (e.g. ROR)  
* related outputs such as publications (e.g. DOI)  
* and other relevant contexts (e.g. projects, grants, versions)  

In practice, this depends on persistent identifiers and structured, machine-readable metadata that travel between repositories, indexing services, and organisational systems.

### Who is this for?

These recommendations are intended for:

* **Researchers** who publish, describe, and cite research data.  
* **Research organisations** that provide policies, infrastructure, and support services for data publication.
