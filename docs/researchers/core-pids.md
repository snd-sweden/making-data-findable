## Use persistent identifiers (PIDs) when publishing and describing data

_All data publications should be assigned a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI). Any research outputs that use or refer to the data should use its unique PID. Identifiers used to describe and link the data to researchers (ORCID) and organisations (ROR) should be specified in the accompanying metadata._

### Why?

PIDs make up a fundamental infrastructure enabling data publications and other research outputs to be found, cited, followed up and linked to the right researcher and organisation over time.
