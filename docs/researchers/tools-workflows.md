## How to describe and share your data through a repository service
Select a suitable repository for your data. Some commonly used alternatives are:

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) - Generalist repository (many different types of data are accepted) hosted by CERN.
Instructions are available at [Zenodo.org](https://help.zenodo.org/)

[SND-DORIS](https://snd.se/en/doris-researchers) - Generalist repository hosted by CERN.
Instructions are available at [SND.se](https://snd.se/en/doris-researchers/describe-data-doris)

[re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) - Comprehensive registry of existing research data repositories. Here you can search for suitable data repositories and find domain specific repositories (focused on specific data types).

## How to add works (e.g. datasets) with a DataCite DOI to your ORCID record

1. Login to your ORCID account
2. Scroll down to _Works_
3. Click on _ADD +_
4. Select _Search and Link_
5. Click on _DataCite_ and authorize access to login to _DataCite Commons_
6. Under _Manage settings_, enable _ORCID Auto-update_ and authorize access again

From your ORCID account you can add additional Link wizards to automatically populate your ORCID record (e.g. CrossRef and OpenAire). Video guides are available at the [ORCID webpage](https://info.orcid.org/video-tutorials/).
