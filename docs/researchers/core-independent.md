## Publish research data as independent, citable objects

_Research data underlying scientific results should be published as independent data publications in an appropriate data repository, rather than attaching them as supplemental materials or referring to them informally._

### Why?

When data are not packaged as independent data publications (datasets) with accompanying metadata, they become invisible in many information flows, impairing traceability, reuse and recognition of the data as a valuable research output.
