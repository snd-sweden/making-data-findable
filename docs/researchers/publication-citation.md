# Publication and citation

## Publish research data as independent, citable objects

_Research data underlying scientific results should be published as independent data publications in an appropriate data repository, rather than attaching them as supplemental materials or referring to them informally._

### Why?

When data are not packaged as independent data publications (datasets) with accompanying metadata, they become invisible in many information flows, impairing traceability, reuse and recognition of the data as a valuable research output.

## Cite data publications using formal references according to established data citation principles

_Data publications underlying scientific results should be cited using formal references in a publication's bibliography, in accordance with established data citation principles._

### Why?

When data publications are not cited as formal references, they are often excluded from metadata flows and automated indexing, which impairs traceability, citability and the ability to follow up research data as valuable research outputs.

## Make data publications visible in research communication and academic portfolios

Researchers should actively highlight their data publications in research communication and academic portfolios—such as CVs, personal websites, research profiles, and applications—in ways that make the data publications clearly identifiable and citable.

### Why?

Data publications are increasingly recognised as standalone research contributions, yet they risk being overlooked if they remain confined to repository interfaces. When data publications are not visible in academic portfolios and research communication, they are difficult to take into account in assessment, monitoring, and research evaluation. This, in turn, reduces incentives to invest time in data publication and good research data management.

### How?

* Include data publications as a separate category in your CV, for example under the heading _Data publications_ or _Research data_.
* Use the persistent identifier of the data publication (e.g. a DOI) as a link, so that the data publication can be accessed and cited directly.
* Make data publications visible on personal websites and research profiles (e.g. ORCID or local profile pages), in the same way as publications.
* Where data publications are central to a research output, refer to them explicitly in research descriptions and applications.
