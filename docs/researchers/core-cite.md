## Cite data publications using formal references according to established data citation principles

_Data publications underlying scientific results should be cited using formal references in a publication's bibliography, in accordance with established data citation principles._

### Why?

When data publications are not cited as formal references, they are often excluded from metadata flows and automated indexing, which impairs traceability, citability and the ability to follow up research data as valuable research outputs.
