## Establish organisational presence in external data repositories

_Research data support functions should, where possible, establish and manage organisational presence in external data repositories used by the institution's researchers. This will enable monitoring and quality assertion of data publications._

### Why?

When data publications are created in external repositories without organisational support, there is a lack of effective ways to find them and quality assure them, which impairs traceability, local follow-up and national output reporting practices.
