## Establish organisational presence in external data repositories

_Research data support functions should, where possible, establish and manage organisational presence in external data repositories used by the institution's researchers. This will enable monitoring and quality assertion of data publications._

### Why?

When data publications are created in external repositories without organisational support, there is a lack of effective ways to find them and quality assure them, which impairs traceability, local follow-up and national output reporting practices.

## How to keep your organization's ROR record updated

To ensure maximum visibility and traceability for the organization's output and impact, it is important to make sure that the metadata connected to ROR is correct and updated, in particular that all common names and/or acronyms ("Other names") are included and searchable.    

1. Search for the organization at [ror org](https://ror.org/search) to view existing details.
2. If something is missing or incorrect, click [Suggest a change](https://curation-request.ror.org/) and follow the instructions. If adding a new organization, please review [ROR criteria for inclusion](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates#ror-scope) first. 
3. Enter as much information as needed and submit the form.  
4. Requests are manually reviewed and changes typically appear in 4-6 weeks.
