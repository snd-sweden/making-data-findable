## Manage and assure the quality of identifiers and basic metadata describing the organisation

_Identifiers (PIDs) and accompanying metadata describing the research organisation should be managed and quality-assured in relevant external infrastructures and services. These include organisational identifiers (e.g. ROR), enclosing official institutional names and other metadata used for expressing institutional affiliation. The use of organisational identifiers should be enabled in local infrastructures and systems, and they should be a preferred method of sharing metadata with external services._

### Why?

Missing or inconsistent organisational metadata in external services impairs the ability to track data publications, link them to the correct institution and reuse information in national and international metadata flows. If organisational PIDs are used and the organisation's core metadata is properly managed, it will reduce the need for manual input by researchers, as well as improve traceability and data quality throughout the research information chain.
