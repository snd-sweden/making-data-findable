## Work with automation and interoperable connections between systems

_Automated and interoperable information flows between relevant research information systems should be pursued, for example between data repositories, CRIS systems, data management planning tools and other administrative systems. Preventing manual duplication of work for researchers as well as research support staff should be a set goal._

### Why?

Lack of integration and interoperability between systems leads to repeated manual entries, varying metadata quality and difficulties in tracking data publications. Automated and standardised workflows improve traceability, quality and efficiency and reduce the administrative burden for both researchers and supporting functions.
